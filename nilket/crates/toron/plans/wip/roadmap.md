# Toron Roadmap

The forward sequence. Stable path (`plans/wip/roadmap.md`) — git holds the
archaeology, this file looks forward.

**Update cadence.** Rewritten at planning sessions, not implementation
commits. The roadmap lags the code on purpose — check `git log` and the
relevant impl plan for actual status. Per-ADR decisions live in
`plans/adr/NNN_*.md` + each ADR's §"What to do next"; this file holds only
the forward view + the active line.

## Status

ADRs 001–127 promoted (implemented unless a `feat` is still pending — check
`git log`). Per-ADR detail in `plans/adr/NNN_*.md`.

## V1 target

"First Query with Integrity" plus "Distributed Execution Correctness":
correct analytical results against a Wendelon-native cluster with pushdown
maximized, identity flow real, stream-shaped storage boundary, multi-process
coordinator/worker mechanics surviving a worker SIGKILL with byte-identical
normalized output, and the first two-input relational operator working across
hash-partitioned and bounded broadcast strategies. Multi-tenant governance,
executor model upgrade, sort-merge, output-side join streaming, and full
end-to-end natural backpressure remain post-V1.

## Prioritization philosophy

Toron is the compute ring of Nilket; Wendelon is the storage ring. We control
both. The boundary exists for scaling dynamics and resource isolation, not
because storage and compute are independent products.

- **Toron's reason for existence is smart-storage pushdown.** Every cut
  polishes a system doing its primary job along its primary axis.
- **Evidence drives scope.** The most informative artifact for the next ADR
  is the previous ADR's bench results or a code-evidence silent-drop /
  inert-feature defect surfaced during selection.
- **Minimize strategic rework.** Two narrow ADR shapes otherwise equivalent
  — prefer the one preserving plausible long-term seams.
- **Ring-product placement** (`plans/conventions/ring-product-placement.md`):
  Interior / shared substrate stays in this Toron sequence; Exterior
  ring-specific products return home to their own ring.
- **Complete cut, not granular slice.** Fold adjacent scope; defer only at
  genuine mechanism/topic boundaries.

## Forward sequence

### ADR 127 promoted; ADR 128 candidates

ADR 127 promoted **Live-chunk release after seal** — the second link of the
live-shuffle memory chain, collapsing the 2-copy steady state ADR 126 left.
Grounded 3-of-3 (Claude final pass, Codex iter-1, Gemini iter-1) on: a
lock-coupled `active_readers` count on `LivePartition` (no count for a
fallback-only `pull_live`); a stream-owned reader guard with dual duty (decrement
once on both stream-end paths **and** preserve 124's unsealed-abnormal-drop
cancellation); idempotent `release_live_chunks_if_idle` (drop `live.chunks` +
the 124 append-side `live.reservations`, never the 126 sealed reservation)
triggered at seal-if-idle and last-reader-end; and the **correctness spine** —
`pull_live` falls back to the sealed payload from `inner.partitions` when
`sealed && chunks` empty (bypassing pacing, yielding once for index 0, erroring
on missing-sealed rather than silent EOF). This also closes a latent
silent-empty-read bug at `partition_store.rs:733`. **Topic was an operator
steer to B over the peers' iter-0 lean to C (SQL broadcast hints)** —
conditioned on the fallback, exactly the B-blocker Codex named; surfaced not
papered. Named for the common-case reclaim (one resident copy after
release/drain), NOT constant memory (worst case — reader mid-stream at seal —
is inherent; literal-constant is the deferred chunk-granular manifest). No
scheduler/consumer/wire change. 15th grounding-correction arc note: the final
promotion corrected the shorthand "3-of-3" wording against the actual peer
files — convergence was substantive, not a same-number iteration claim.

**ADR 128 lead candidate — SQL broadcast join hint authoring** (Codex+Gemini's
iter-0 pick, deferred by sequencing not correctness): retarget
`adr125_no_sql_hint_authoring_yet`, read `optimizer_hints` in `lower_select`
(`sql_planner.rs:2560`), lower `/*+ BROADCAST(alias) */` to the existing
`JoinStrategy::Broadcast`. No preprocessor, no sqlparser change — the AST
already carries hints. INNER-only, hinted relation = left/build, reject
mismatched/unused hints.

### ADR 126 promoted (HISTORICAL)

ADR 126 promoted **Live-shuffle seal correction** — the first link of ADR
125's deferred "live shuffle memory chain." Genuine 3-of-3 (Fork A) after
Codex's iter-0 *proved* (throwaway Arrow IPC test) a latent multi-chunk
data-loss bug: `seal_live`'s chunk fallback byte-concatenated N framed IPC
streams, and the single `StreamReader` stops at the first EOS → only the
first chunk's rows survive (invisible because the one covering test used
synthetic non-IPC bytes). The cut makes `live.chunks` the **single source**
seal derives from via streaming Arrow IPC reassembly (decode→write→drop per
chunk); drops `partition_batches` decoded retention + the live producer's
redundant `publish_task_output` + `TaskBatch` transmission (general publish
path preserved for non-live producers); carries `schema: Option<SchemaRef>`
on `LivePartition` so empty partitions seal as schema-bearing IPC; reserves
the sealed payload atomically (no partial publish on budget exhaustion);
manifest-derived telemetry; **retargets the one 124 guard**
(`adr124_seal_live_materializes_from_chunks` → reassembly invariant). Named
"correction," NOT "single-pass/constant-memory" — encode count stays 2,
resident copies stay 2 (chunks stay resident for in-flight `pull_live` +
retry-from-zero). 14th grounding-correction in the 119→126 arc (Claude's
"3→1 copy" headline + "no 124 guard inverts" both corrected; Gemini conceded
Fork B→A on grounded schema-availability). Substrate behavior change; no new
IR/opcode/wire type.

**Live shuffle memory chain — remaining link** (post-127):
chunk-granular sealed manifest (true constant-memory / single-copy:
multi-entry-per-partition manifest OR streaming sealed assembly — the only
path to "1 copy" without retaining one sealed partition payload in the store).

**Distributed execution arc:** executor build/probe reorder (pairs with
124 for end-to-end natural backpressure); output-side
joins-as-streamable-producers (widen `streamable_unary_plan` for `Join` +
restructure executor); multi-producer fan-in + remote live transport
(Codex's three-substrate framing); configurable `LIVE_BACKLOG_DEPTH` via
`QueryBudget`.

**Broadcast continuation:** SQL broadcast hint authoring (needs
`sqlparser` hint preservation grounding — don't invent a preprocessor);
non-INNER broadcast widening (binder + fragmenter per-kind correctness
proofs); cost-based strategy selection (needs cardinality estimates not
in IR today).

**Identity tier:** logical-type lifecycle (`DROP`/`ALTER LOGICAL TYPE` —
cross-ring DROP + referential integrity, bounded 090 re-open);
declared-additive types (`SUM(Money) → Money` via logical-type property);
PK/FK-derived identity (blocked on FK support at `sql_planner.rs:663`).

**Frontend:** qualified wildcards (`t.*` + mixed — planner↔binder
restructuring or `Wildcard` IR variant); qualified DML RETURNING; DML
target aliases / qualified assignment targets; SQL joins around derived
tables / GROUP BY over joins; Rune sort/limit; SIMILAR TO / RLIKE / REGEXP.

**Distributed (other):** streamable Sort/Aggregate coverage (120 V2 —
top-k bounded buffers + partial+merge); row-group-lazy-from-disk scan
(118 follow-on — per disk page laziness).

**Optimizer / catalog:** general project-fusion beyond 105's
adjacent-identity case (evidence-gated); further `information_schema`
relations (constraints / indexes / PK-FK / views); Wendelon `*V1`/`*v1`
de-version sweep (Wendelon-home chore).

**Long-horizon:** subquery/`UNNEST`/row-value `IN`; `CHECK`/`DEFAULT`;
`ALTER`/composite-PK/`UNIQUE`; pre-op intent audit; fragmentable bulk DML;
JWT/OIDC/SPIFFE; gRPC/Arrow Flight/Postgres frontends.
