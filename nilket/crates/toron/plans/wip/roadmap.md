# Toron Roadmap

The forward sequence. Stable path (`plans/wip/roadmap.md`) — git holds the
archaeology, this file looks forward.

**Update cadence.** Rewritten at planning sessions, not implementation
commits. The roadmap lags the code on purpose — check `git log` and the
relevant impl plan for actual status. Per-ADR decisions live in
`plans/adr/NNN_*.md` + each ADR's §"What to do next"; this file holds only
the forward view + the active line.

## Status

ADRs 001–125 promoted (implemented unless a `feat` is still pending — check
`git log`). Per-ADR detail in `plans/adr/NNN_*.md`.

## V1 target

"First Query with Integrity" plus "Distributed Execution Correctness":
correct analytical results against a Wendelon-native cluster with pushdown
maximized, identity flow real, stream-shaped storage boundary, multi-process
coordinator/worker mechanics surviving a worker SIGKILL with byte-identical
normalized output, and the first two-input relational operator working across
hash-partitioned and bounded broadcast strategies. Multi-tenant governance,
executor model upgrade, sort-merge, output-side join streaming, and full
end-to-end natural backpressure remain post-V1.

## Prioritization philosophy

Toron is the compute ring of Nilket; Wendelon is the storage ring. We control
both. The boundary exists for scaling dynamics and resource isolation, not
because storage and compute are independent products.

- **Toron's reason for existence is smart-storage pushdown.** Every cut
  polishes a system doing its primary job along its primary axis.
- **Evidence drives scope.** The most informative artifact for the next ADR
  is the previous ADR's bench results or a code-evidence silent-drop /
  inert-feature defect surfaced during selection.
- **Minimize strategic rework.** Two narrow ADR shapes otherwise equivalent
  — prefer the one preserving plausible long-term seams.
- **Ring-product placement** (`plans/conventions/ring-product-placement.md`):
  Interior / shared substrate stays in this Toron sequence; Exterior
  ring-specific products return home to their own ring.
- **Complete cut, not granular slice.** Fold adjacent scope; defer only at
  genuine mechanism/topic boundaries.

## Forward sequence

### ADR 125 promoted; ADR 126 candidates

ADR 125 promoted **Rune broadcast join authoring** — single new method
`df.broadcast_join(other, on)` (receiver = LEFT = build = small);
strategy-aware helper rename `build_hash_join_plan` →
`build_join_plan(.., strategy)` with internal `JoinStrategy` match (no
compat wrapper); INNER-only at API construction + defensive frontend
reject; 3 callsite updates + 3 retargeted 122 guards + 6 new 125 guards +
9 behavior gates; G-A authored equivalence mirrors `lib.rs:594` end-to-end.
Genuine 3-of-3 after iter-1 grounding toppled the Gemini/Codex iter-0
"constant-memory live shuffle" framing (13th grounding-correction in the
119→125 arc — `partition_store.rs:501-515` + `server/mod.rs:511` showed
`live.chunks` retains all encoded bytes through seal AND publish path
double-encodes + double-reserves). No substrate change.

**Live shuffle memory chain** (Codex's deferred honest scope):
ledger-backed live shuffle sealing (drop `partition_batches` RecordBatch
retention + double publish/budget reservation; **must include
empty-partition schema-bearing Arrow IPC fix** — `seal_live` produces
empty bytes for never-appended partitions); chunk-granular sealed manifest
(true constant-memory; multi-entry-per-partition OR streaming sealed
assembly).

**Distributed execution arc:** executor build/probe reorder (pairs with
124 for end-to-end natural backpressure); output-side
joins-as-streamable-producers (widen `streamable_unary_plan` for `Join` +
restructure executor); multi-producer fan-in + remote live transport
(Codex's three-substrate framing); configurable `LIVE_BACKLOG_DEPTH` via
`QueryBudget`.

**Broadcast continuation:** SQL broadcast hint authoring (needs
`sqlparser` hint preservation grounding — don't invent a preprocessor);
non-INNER broadcast widening (binder + fragmenter per-kind correctness
proofs); cost-based strategy selection (needs cardinality estimates not
in IR today).

**Identity tier:** logical-type lifecycle (`DROP`/`ALTER LOGICAL TYPE` —
cross-ring DROP + referential integrity, bounded 090 re-open);
declared-additive types (`SUM(Money) → Money` via logical-type property);
PK/FK-derived identity (blocked on FK support at `sql_planner.rs:663`).

**Frontend:** qualified wildcards (`t.*` + mixed — planner↔binder
restructuring or `Wildcard` IR variant); qualified DML RETURNING; DML
target aliases / qualified assignment targets; SQL joins around derived
tables / GROUP BY over joins; Rune sort/limit; SIMILAR TO / RLIKE / REGEXP.

**Distributed (other):** streamable Sort/Aggregate coverage (120 V2 —
top-k bounded buffers + partial+merge); row-group-lazy-from-disk scan
(118 follow-on — per disk page laziness).

**Optimizer / catalog:** general project-fusion beyond 105's
adjacent-identity case (evidence-gated); further `information_schema`
relations (constraints / indexes / PK-FK / views); Wendelon `*V1`/`*v1`
de-version sweep (Wendelon-home chore).

**Long-horizon:** subquery/`UNNEST`/row-value `IN`; `CHECK`/`DEFAULT`;
`ALTER`/composite-PK/`UNIQUE`; pre-op intent audit; fragmentable bulk DML;
JWT/OIDC/SPIFFE; gRPC/Arrow Flight/Postgres frontends.
