# Toron Roadmap

The forward sequence. Stable path (`plans/wip/roadmap.md`) — git holds the
archaeology, this file looks forward.

**Update cadence.** Rewritten at planning sessions, not implementation
commits. The roadmap lags the code on purpose — check `git log` and the
relevant impl plan for actual status. Per-ADR decisions live in
`plans/adr/NNN_*.md` + each ADR's §"What to do next"; this file holds only
the forward view + the active line.

## Status

ADRs 001–131 promoted (implemented unless a `feat` is still pending — check
`git log`). Per-ADR detail in `plans/adr/NNN_*.md`.

## V1 target

"First Query with Integrity" plus "Distributed Execution Correctness":
correct analytical results against a Wendelon-native cluster with pushdown
maximized, identity flow real, stream-shaped storage boundary, multi-process
coordinator/worker mechanics surviving a worker SIGKILL with byte-identical
normalized output, and the first two-input relational operator working across
hash-partitioned and bounded broadcast strategies. Multi-tenant governance,
executor model upgrade, sort-merge, output-side join streaming, and full
end-to-end natural backpressure remain post-V1.

## Prioritization philosophy

Toron is the compute ring of Nilket; Wendelon is the storage ring. We control
both. The boundary exists for scaling dynamics and resource isolation, not
because storage and compute are independent products.

- **Toron's reason for existence is smart-storage pushdown.** Every cut
  polishes a system doing its primary job along its primary axis.
- **Evidence drives scope.** The most informative artifact for the next ADR
  is the previous ADR's bench results or a code-evidence silent-drop /
  inert-feature defect surfaced during selection.
- **Minimize strategic rework.** Two narrow ADR shapes otherwise equivalent
  — prefer the one preserving plausible long-term seams.
- **Ring-product placement** (`plans/conventions/ring-product-placement.md`):
  Interior / shared substrate stays in this Toron sequence; Exterior
  ring-specific products return home to their own ring.
- **Complete cut, not granular slice.** Fold adjacent scope; defer only at
  genuine mechanism/topic boundaries.

## Forward sequence

### ADR 131 promoted; ADR 132 candidates

ADR 131 promoted **Scan-linear Broadcast Probe Eligibility** — corrects ADR 130's
over-strict probe fence (which silently regressed 129) by splitting build
eligibility (a *fact* predicate: single base relation + hard byte bound) from
probe eligibility (a *plan-shape* predicate). The probe may now be **scan-linear**
— a `Scan { row_limit: None }` optionally wrapped in row-local `Filter`/`Project`
— restoring the filtered/projected-fact star-schema path 130 narrowed
(`dim JOIN (fact WHERE …)` and `(fact WHERE …) JOIN dim`). Grounded in the
share-scan substrate: the broadcast consumer applies the probe per morsel
(`TaskInputBinding::Scan { share }`), so nested-join (not recursively fragmented),
aggregate/sort/take (global/ordering), exchange (repartition), limited-scan
(per-worker limit), system-table probes (duplicate per worker), and empty probes
(unneeded for this cut) stay hash. `bind_join` computes two
scan-linear bools and passes them via `JoinInputOptimization` into the single
`choose_auto_join_strategy` seam; the predicate is an **exhaustive**
`ExecutionPlan` walk (compiler forces a decision on new variants). 130's swap +
restoring projection and left-wins tie are unchanged; the 130 single-seam guard
is **retargeted**, not deleted. Genuine 3-of-3. Load-bearing gate:
`left_tiny_with_filtered_probe_infers_broadcast` fails on the pre-131 code.

**ADR 132 lead candidates:** smaller-build dominance comparator (the first real
cost *weigh* — choose the materially-smaller build when both sides are eligible,
with a named left-biased margin, on the now-honest predicate); multi-way
star-join ordering (133+ — lifts the nested-join probe fence; needs recursive
fragmentation of a nested broadcast probe, real substrate work); Wendelon-backed
live table-size facts (storage-ring producer — flips dark-launch to default-on);
selectivity propagation; optimizer `EXPLAIN` over the reason receipts (now able
to report `ProbeNotScanLinear`). Evidence-gate the pick on the 131 feat.

### ADR 129 promoted (HISTORICAL)

ADR 129 promoted **Optimizer Fact Spine for Tiny Broadcast Inference** — the
roadmap pivot's first step toward a cost-based optimizer. Builds a conservative
**fact spine** (hard `byte`/`row` upper bounds on `TableBinding`, propagated to
bound subplans) and spends it on one fenced rule: unhinted INNER joins whose
**syntactic-left** input is a single base relation with a hard byte bound below an
effective dark-launched threshold infer `JoinStrategy::Broadcast`; everything
else stays hash. Seam is **binding-time** (grounded: `SqlPlanner` is a
catalog-free unit struct; the binder owns catalog + `PlannerConfig`) via a single
`choose_join_strategy(...) -> {strategy, reason}` helper (the spine-honesty gate —
a 2nd CBO rule is a new arm, not a new branch). `LogicalPlan::Join` gains
`JoinStrategyIntent::{Auto, Pinned}`; `ExecutionPlan::Join` stays concrete; `Auto`
never survives binding. Fork A exchange placement (pinned stays planner-shaped,
auto shaped in binder) as **named temporary debt**. Row facts from `Take`/`LIMIT
0`/`EmptyRelation` folded into the spine but **carried, not scheduled on** (no
fragmenter/dispatch change). Config dark-launched `None`; the effective threshold
is capped by a static conservative broadcast-cap ceiling until actual
`QueryBudget` reaches binding, so production inference stays inert until a real
Wendelon-facts producer ADR plus knob enablement. Genuine 3-of-3 after three
grounding corrections (planner→binder placement; hard-bounds over `confidence`;
no-hash-hint precedence gate — ADR 128 only added `BROADCAST`). Retargets
122/125/128 join guards; do-no-harm inference, fail-loud hints unchanged.

**ADR 130 lead candidates** (the CBO arc now has a spine to extend): right-side
build selection + output-order preservation (the real `fact JOIN dim`
star-schema win — dim on the right); Wendelon-backed live table-size facts
(storage-ring producer ADR — flips 129's config to default-on); unify exchange
insertion (pays the Fork-A debt once a pinned-reshaping rule earns it);
selectivity propagation; fold ADR 116 take / ADR 095 empty-relation into the
general fact model; zero-worker / coordinator-local placement; optimizer
`EXPLAIN` over the reason receipts. Evidence-gate the pick on the 129 feat.

### ADR 128 promoted (HISTORICAL)

ADR 128 promoted **SQL broadcast join hint authoring** — closes the broadcast
authoring story (125 did Rune; this does SQL). `SELECT /*+ BROADCAST(alias) */
… INNER JOIN …` lowers to the existing `JoinStrategy::Broadcast` via a strict
raw-text recognizer over `OptimizerHint.text`; build-side resolution through
121's `plan_qualifiers`; no-silent-fallback reject of malformed / right-side /
non-INNER / ambiguous / composite-left / unused hints; EXISTS stays hash. **No
dialect/parser/substrate change** — `GenericDialect` already captures comment
hints (`generic.rs:288`); the cut replaces `lower_select`'s blanket hint reject
(`:2560`) only. Behavioral 3-of-3 with the promoted mechanics incorporating
three sqlparser-layer grounding corrections (wrong crate version 0.59→0.62;
hints are raw text not parsed `Expr`; `GenericDialect` already captures →
Claude's `ToronDialect` was unnecessary and conceded iter-2). Retargets
`adr125_no_sql_hint_authoring_yet` →
`adr128_sql_broadcast_hint_authoring_is_narrow`; adds a
`generic_dialect_remains` guard memorializing the no-dialect-change correction.

**ADR 129 lead candidates** (no strong continuity pull — broadcast surface now
whole, live-shuffle memory chain has one remaining link): chunk-granular sealed
manifest (the last live-shuffle memory link — true 1-copy, consumer-`pull`-API
break); executor build/probe reorder → streamable joins (the big distributed
arc); non-INNER broadcast widening (per-kind binder/fragmenter proofs);
frontend (qualified `t.*`, joins over derived tables). Evidence-gate the pick
on whatever the 128 feat surfaces.

### ADR 127 promoted (HISTORICAL)

ADR 127 promoted **Live-chunk release after seal** — the second link of the
live-shuffle memory chain, collapsing the 2-copy steady state ADR 126 left.
Grounded 3-of-3 (Claude final pass, Codex iter-1, Gemini iter-1) on: a
lock-coupled `active_readers` count on `LivePartition` (no count for a
fallback-only `pull_live`); a stream-owned reader guard with dual duty (decrement
once on both stream-end paths **and** preserve 124's unsealed-abnormal-drop
cancellation); idempotent `release_live_chunks_if_idle` (drop `live.chunks` +
the 124 append-side `live.reservations`, never the 126 sealed reservation)
triggered at seal-if-idle and last-reader-end; and the **correctness spine** —
`pull_live` falls back to the sealed payload from `inner.partitions` when
`sealed && chunks` empty (bypassing pacing, yielding once for index 0, erroring
on missing-sealed rather than silent EOF). This also closes a latent
silent-empty-read bug at `partition_store.rs:733`. **Topic was an operator
steer to B over the peers' iter-0 lean to C (SQL broadcast hints)** —
conditioned on the fallback, exactly the B-blocker Codex named; surfaced not
papered. Named for the common-case reclaim (one resident copy after
release/drain), NOT constant memory (worst case — reader mid-stream at seal —
is inherent; literal-constant is the deferred chunk-granular manifest). No
scheduler/consumer/wire change. 15th grounding-correction arc note: the final
promotion corrected the shorthand "3-of-3" wording against the actual peer
files — convergence was substantive, not a same-number iteration claim.

### ADR 126 promoted (HISTORICAL)

ADR 126 promoted **Live-shuffle seal correction** — the first link of ADR
125's deferred "live shuffle memory chain." Genuine 3-of-3 (Fork A) after
Codex's iter-0 *proved* (throwaway Arrow IPC test) a latent multi-chunk
data-loss bug: `seal_live`'s chunk fallback byte-concatenated N framed IPC
streams, and the single `StreamReader` stops at the first EOS → only the
first chunk's rows survive (invisible because the one covering test used
synthetic non-IPC bytes). The cut makes `live.chunks` the **single source**
seal derives from via streaming Arrow IPC reassembly (decode→write→drop per
chunk); drops `partition_batches` decoded retention + the live producer's
redundant `publish_task_output` + `TaskBatch` transmission (general publish
path preserved for non-live producers); carries `schema: Option<SchemaRef>`
on `LivePartition` so empty partitions seal as schema-bearing IPC; reserves
the sealed payload atomically (no partial publish on budget exhaustion);
manifest-derived telemetry; **retargets the one 124 guard**
(`adr124_seal_live_materializes_from_chunks` → reassembly invariant). Named
"correction," NOT "single-pass/constant-memory" — encode count stays 2,
resident copies stay 2 (chunks stay resident for in-flight `pull_live` +
retry-from-zero). 14th grounding-correction in the 119→126 arc (Claude's
"3→1 copy" headline + "no 124 guard inverts" both corrected; Gemini conceded
Fork B→A on grounded schema-availability). Substrate behavior change; no new
IR/opcode/wire type.

**Live shuffle memory chain — remaining link** (post-127):
chunk-granular sealed manifest (true constant-memory / single-copy:
multi-entry-per-partition manifest OR streaming sealed assembly — the only
path to "1 copy" without retaining one sealed partition payload in the store).

**Distributed execution arc:** executor build/probe reorder (pairs with
124 for end-to-end natural backpressure); output-side
joins-as-streamable-producers (widen `streamable_unary_plan` for `Join` +
restructure executor); multi-producer fan-in + remote live transport
(Codex's three-substrate framing); configurable `LIVE_BACKLOG_DEPTH` via
`QueryBudget`.

**Broadcast continuation:** non-INNER broadcast widening (binder + fragmenter
per-kind correctness proofs); cost-based strategy selection (needs cardinality
estimates not in IR today).

**Identity tier:** logical-type lifecycle (`DROP`/`ALTER LOGICAL TYPE` —
cross-ring DROP + referential integrity, bounded 090 re-open);
declared-additive types (`SUM(Money) → Money` via logical-type property);
PK/FK-derived identity (blocked on FK support at `sql_planner.rs:663`).

**Frontend:** qualified wildcards (`t.*` + mixed — planner↔binder
restructuring or `Wildcard` IR variant); qualified DML RETURNING; DML
target aliases / qualified assignment targets; SQL joins around derived
tables / GROUP BY over joins; Rune sort/limit; SIMILAR TO / RLIKE / REGEXP.

**Distributed (other):** streamable Sort/Aggregate coverage (120 V2 —
top-k bounded buffers + partial+merge); row-group-lazy-from-disk scan
(118 follow-on — per disk page laziness).

**Optimizer / catalog:** general project-fusion beyond 105's
adjacent-identity case (evidence-gated); further `information_schema`
relations (constraints / indexes / PK-FK / views); Wendelon `*V1`/`*v1`
de-version sweep (Wendelon-home chore).

**Long-horizon:** subquery/`UNNEST`/row-value `IN`; `CHECK`/`DEFAULT`;
`ALTER`/composite-PK/`UNIQUE`; pre-op intent audit; fragmentable bulk DML;
JWT/OIDC/SPIFFE; gRPC/Arrow Flight/Postgres frontends.
