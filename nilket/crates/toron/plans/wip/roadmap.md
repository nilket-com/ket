# Toron Roadmap

The forward sequence. Stable path (`plans/wip/roadmap.md`) —
git holds the archaeology, this file looks forward.

**Update cadence.** Rewritten at planning sessions, not at
implementation commits. The council operates on a block-chain
rhythm: plan → implement → plan → implement, and this file is
a snapshot of the most recent plan. Between sessions the
roadmap lags the code on purpose — an item can read "ADR N
implementation phases pending" while several phases have
already landed on `main`. That is expected. Check `git log`
and the relevant impl plan / bench-results file for actual
status, and roll roadmap edits into the next planning session
along with the forward-sequence rewrite.

## Status

- **ADR 001 — Foundation and Engine Contract.** Promoted + implemented.
- **ADR 002 — Storage-Backed Execution Contract.** Promoted + implemented.
  Bench: `plans/impl/002_storage_execution_contract_bench_results.md`.
- **ADR 003 — Distributed Runtime and Data Movement.** Promoted + implemented.
  Bench: `plans/impl/003_distributed_runtime_bench_results.md`.
- **ADR 004 — Distributed Inner Equi-Join.** Promoted + implemented.
  Bench: `plans/impl/004_distributed_inner_equi_join_bench_results.md`.
- **ADR 005 — Hash-Join Build Path Efficiency.** Promoted + implemented.
  Bench: `plans/impl/005_hash_join_build_path_efficiency_bench_results.md`.
- **ADR 006 — Runtime Filter Pushdown.** Promoted + implemented. Advisory
  Bloom runtime filters for hash-partitioned inner equi-joins via two-wave
  execution. Bench: `plans/impl/006_runtime_filter_pushdown_bench_results.md`.
- **ADR 007 — Rune Sandbox Enforcement.** Promoted + implemented.
  Process-internal sandbox contract for user-supplied Rune scripts.
- **ADR 008 — Outer / Semi / Anti Joins.** Promoted + implemented. `JoinKind`
  to 8 variants; bench:
  `plans/impl/008_outer_semi_anti_joins_bench_results.md`.
- **ADR 009 — Correlated `EXISTS` / `NOT EXISTS` Decorrelation.** Promoted +
  implemented. SQL-AST rewrite in `SqlPlanner::lower_select` lowering
  correlated `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` to `LeftSemi`/`LeftAnti` joins.
- **ADR 010 — Top-Level SQL Clause Accounting and Deterministic Result
  Ordering.** Promoted + implemented. Exhaustive `Query`/`Select` field
  accounting plus `LogicalPlan::Sort` / `ExecutionPlan::Sort` over a single
  terminal gather-sort.
- **ADR 011 — Aggregate Projection Accounting and `GROUP BY` SQL
  Reachability.** Promoted + implemented. Strict aggregate projection-item
  accounting; narrow single-table `GROUP BY` wired to the grouped aggregate
  path.
- **ADR 012 — Mixed-Wildcard Projection Accounting and Planner Hardening.**
  Promoted + implemented. Non-aggregate projection silent-drop closed;
  `TIME_BUCKET` arity hardened.
- **ADR 013 — Runtime Filter Application at the Storage-Scan Boundary.**
  Promoted + implemented. Both `StorageScan` impls apply
  `request.runtime_filter`; Wendelon table-query wire carries
  `runtime_filter_len`; production Wendelon-enabled selective row in
  `plans/impl/006_runtime_filter_pushdown_bench_results.md`.
- **ADR 014 — Exact Small-Set Runtime Filters.** Promoted + implemented.
  ExactSet runtime-filter kind for hash-partitioned inner equi-joins with
  small build sets (gate: serialized exact payload ≤ Bloom
  `MIN_FILTER_BYTES`); coordinator lowers exact-to-Bloom on overflow. Proving
  production Wendelon row appended to
  `plans/impl/006_runtime_filter_pushdown_bench_results.md`.

V1 target is **"First Query with Integrity"** plus
**"Distributed Execution Correctness"**: correct analytical
results against a Wendelon-native cluster with pushdown
maximized, identity flow real, stream-shaped storage
boundary, multi-process coordinator/worker mechanics
surviving a worker SIGKILL with byte-identical normalized
output, and the first two-input relational operator working
across hash-partitioned and bounded broadcast strategies.
Multi-tenant governance, executor model upgrade, sort-merge,
and pipelined cross-stage execution
remain post-V1.

## Prioritization philosophy

Toron is the compute ring of the Nilket stack; Wendelon is
the storage ring. We control both ends. The boundary exists
for scaling dynamics and resource isolation, not because
storage and compute are independent products.

**Toron's reason for existence is smart-storage pushdown.** Every
improvement — executor model upgrade, advanced kernels, frontend
hardening — polishes a system that does its primary job along its
primary axis.

**ADR-by-ADR cadence.** Wendelon ADR 070 pattern: narrow,
evidence-driven, single-decision contracts. Each ADR earns its
scope from the prior ADR's bench evidence or a fresh code-evidence
defect; mega-scopes get split.

**Evidence drives scope.** The most informative artifact for the
next ADR is the previous ADR's bench results — or a code-evidence
silent-drop / inert-feature defect surfaced during selection.
**Evidence Pressure > Launch Pressure** when both are live: the
council picks the topic with measured signal, not the one with
the loudest backlog.

**Scale-boundary convention (adopted iter-5 of ADR 006).** Every
ADR from ADR 006 forward includes an explicit **Scale boundary**
section after Status and before Context. The decomposition makes
scope-creep into adjacent boundaries visible at review time and
sharpens ADR selection: the same operator at different scales is
a different contract.

## Forward sequence

Earlier items have firmer scope; later items are direction,
not commitment.

### Promoted: ADR 014 plan

ADR 014's contract is pinned at
`plans/adr/014_exact_small_set_runtime_filters.md`; the impl plan
lives at `plans/impl/014_exact_small_set_runtime_filters.md`.
Implementation is pending. The proving bench row will append to
`plans/impl/006_runtime_filter_pushdown_bench_results.md`
alongside ADR 006's motivating Phase 0 row and ADR 013's
production row.

### ADR 015 candidates

**Lead candidate — `GROUP BY ... ORDER BY`.** Pre-converged in
the ADR 014 selection round: all three council members named the
same three-stage fragmenter shape (scan/projection producers →
group-keyed exchange into grouped aggregate consumers → terminal
gather exchange into one final `Sort` task). Composes ADR 010
(`Sort`) and ADR 011 (`Aggregate`) with no new IR variant;
planner reject is at `sql_planner.rs:98`. Two real iter-1
questions carried forward from the ADR 014 cycle: terminal-gather
representation in the scheduler / fragmenter, and the
`lower_query` seam at the reject site.

**Other ADR 011 SQL-surface follow-ons** remain explicit
candidates: `GROUP BY` over joins, `HAVING`, `DISTINCT`,
post-aggregate projection (aliases, reordering, key subsets,
computed keys), two-phase partial/final aggregation, and
aggregate-catalog widening (`AVG` / `MIN` / `MAX` and
experimental-kernel graduation). They promote only if evidence
beats the lead candidate.

**Standing A–E candidates** rotate forward beneath the lead.
Candidate B (cross-process wire efficiency) is parked unless
non-selective workload pressure surfaces — the ADR 013/014
runtime-filter row reduction landed a clear hit on the selective
workload. Candidate C (V1.x runtime-filter extensions beyond
ExactSet — broadcast, outer/anti, planner cost model,
encoded-type widening) remains a cluster of narrow follow-on
ADRs, each requiring its own evidence trigger.

#### Candidate A — Multi-tenant resource governance

**Scale boundary:** cluster-wide.

Per-query to per-tenant budgets, token-bucket admission,
scheduler-slot allocation, memory-rejection vs spill-trigger
thresholds. Promotes if V1 launch pressure surfaces
multi-tenancy before joins-adjacent perf work.

ADR 003's per-query `QueryBudget` is the natural antecedent;
the per-tenant layer wants real multi-tenant workload evidence
before its shape gets pinned. ADR 007 explicitly deferred
per-tenant Rune budgets to this work (L-3 from the topics
cycle).

#### Candidate B — Cross-process wire efficiency

**Scale boundary:** transport.

The compute-ring fallback if later production-scale Wendelon
runtime-filter evidence misses launch needs or non-selective
workloads dominate post-V1. Batch-size policy, Arrow IPC encode/decode
tuning, `WireEnvelope` overhead audit, output-publish path
streamlining. No cross-ring dependency.

Promotes if production-scale evidence shows the selective
runtime-filter path misses its target or if non-selective workloads
dominate the V1 launch shape. Lower leverage than ADR 006 on
selective joins (moves bytes faster vs avoids moving rejected
bytes), but uniform across selective and non-selective workloads.
Phase 0 sub-bucket selection discipline preserved if C promotes
(no grab-bag wire-perf ADR).

#### Candidate C — V1.x runtime-filter extensions

**Scale boundary:** cross-ring (continuation of ADR 006).

A cluster of follow-on work to ADR 006 and ADR 013, now unblocked by
production Wendelon-side row landing:

- ~~**Exact `InList` filters** for small build sets~~ — **covered
  by ADR 014** (ExactSet runtime-filter kind). The roadmap's
  ≥50%-with-material-FP gates cleared on the ADR 006 Phase 0 row;
  ADR 014 introduces the `RuntimeFilterKind::ExactSet` descriptor
  variant rather than the SQL-`InList` / PBC-`InList` framing
  this bullet originally implied.
- **Broadcast-strategy runtime filters.** ADR 006 V1 limits
  filter eligibility to hash-partitioned joins. Broadcast
  filters reuse the descriptor contract with a different
  attachment path.
- **Outer / semi / anti runtime-filter pushdown.** ADR 008
  reserved this — runtime filters on outer / anti probe sides
  would incorrectly drop rows the outer-preservation semantics
  require. A "filter + null-pad" combined operator is the
  separable design.
- **Planner cost-model opt-in.** Always-two-wave in V1;
  planner-stats opt-in once stats exist.
- **Filter eligibility extension to canonical-encoder
  additions.** When the canonical encoder grows support for
  `Date`, `Timestamp`, or `Decimal`, filter eligibility extends
  with it.

Each sub-item is plausibly its own narrow ADR. Held as topic cards
until one extension wins the next planning pass.

#### Candidate D — Worker-side Rune UDF execution

**Scale boundary:** operator-level + process-internal
(distributed sandbox).

Reserved. ADR 007 explicitly scoped row-level Rune UDFs out.
This is the substantial new ADR if a future feature needs
worker-side script execution — covers distributed sandbox +
per-worker budget interaction + the `TaskFailureKind`
reason-string mapping ADR 007 reserved as the forward seam.

#### Candidate E — Executor model upgrade

**Scale boundary:** operator-level (executor substrate).

Demoted by ADR 004 sub-attribution and re-confirmed by ADR 005
+ ADR 006 (probe + output combined < 15% of wall on selective
workloads; even smaller post-filter). Reserved for the case
where a future workload (large probe-side without filtering,
multi-way joins, complex aggregates) shows probe-side
dominance. Stays demoted.

### Advanced kernel graduations *(one ADR per kernel)*

Wendelon ADR 070 narrow-decision pattern. Each promotes
under its own ADR with bench evidence. Inherited from
prior roadmap, unchanged:

- **`LinearRegress` stable contract.** Numerical hardening
  (condition-number guard, centered formula, rank check)
  + stability across numeric types.
- **`ApproxQuantile` stable contract.** Real rank-based
  estimation against KLL retained values + cross-impl
  parity with Wendelon's KLL substrate.
- **`TimeBucket` stable contract.** Bucket-alignment
  semantics across timezone, duration, and pre-epoch
  inputs.

### Brainstorms and high-level vision

Long-horizon shapes the council has noted but not
committed.

- **Brainstorm 001: Pure Cranelift JIT as a First-Class
  Query Specializer.** JIT-compile hot kernels (predicates,
  UDFs, hash-join probe loops) into native machine code for
  zero-copy, bare-metal performance. Reserved for post-V1
  deliberation when bench evidence quantifies the
  interpretation overhead.
- **Brainstorm 002: WeakControlRing.** In-memory Raft ring
  for HA coordinators, cluster-wide quotas, and shuffle
  barrier synchronization without the persistence tax of
  NVMe / WAL. ADR 003's `WorkerRegistry` trait +
  `WorkerLease` / `LeaseEpoch` fields are the seam.
- **Brainstorm 003: Smart-Storage Pushdown beyond
  filters.** Toron's pushdown story now covers static
  predicates (ADR 002), shuffle-key affinity (ADR 003),
  and *runtime* join-key filtering (ADR 006 generation plus ADR
  013 storage-scan application). Future
  pushdown surfaces: aggregate partial pushdown (already
  half-Wendelon-bound), top-K / sort pushdown,
  projection-with-computed-column pushdown. Each is its
  own ADR; the cumulative shape is "Toron binds; Wendelon
  executes the leaves; the wire carries results, not
  bytes." ADR 006 and ADR 013 together form the runtime-pushdown
  substrate that V1.x runtime-filter extensions (Candidate C
  above) build on.

### V1.x items *(post-V1, evidence-driven)*

Items the council has explicitly deferred from V1 ADRs.
Promoted to their own ADRs when evidence drives them.

- **Non-equi joins / theta-joins.** Own ADR.
- **Sort-merge join.** ADR 010 pins the top-level `ORDER BY`
  contract and the `Sort` operator; sort-merge join builds on
  that ordering antecedent. Still its own ADR — needs the
  join-side ordering and merge-path decisions.
- **Cross-join.** Own ADR or V1.x SQL surface.
- **Cost-based build/probe swap; cost-based strategy
  selection.** Requires Wendelon stats surface and Toron
  cost model. Will land `BuildSide` field on
  `ExecutionPlan::Join` when it engages.
- **Multi-way join planning.** Requires cost model.
- **Skew detection + mitigation.** ADR 004 ships
  observation only (soft gate). Mitigation needs heavy-
  hitter detection, salt-and-replicate, dynamic
  partition-count override. Own ADR.
- **SQL join hint syntax.** `/*+ BROADCAST(t) */` and
  similar. V1.x SQL surface.
- **`USING` clause; comma-join; `CROSS JOIN`.** V1.x SQL
  sugar.
- **Floating-point join keys.** Requires canonical-
  encoding ADR (NaN, signed zero, subnormals).
- **Intra-task build / probe pipelining.** V1.x executor
  work; depends on Candidate E (executor model upgrade)
  outcome.
- **Hash-spill-to-memory demotion.** ADR 004 ships one-way
  spill; demotion is V1.x when bench shows churn benefits.
- **SQL-surface auto-rename of duplicate output column
  names.** ADR 004 requires explicit qualification.
- **Pipelined cross-stage execution.** ADR 003 ships
  strict stage barriers; pipelining adds latency wins at
  the cost of failure-recovery complexity. V1.x when the
  failure-recovery story is concrete.
- **Locality-aware fragment routing.** ADR 003 +
  ADR 004 are location-agnostic; locality requires new
  Wendelon public-API surface.
- **RDMA / RoCEv2 / SIW transport tier.** M9 seeds the
  transport-tier-negotiation shape; QUIC preferred
  through V1.
- **Operator-internal streaming end-to-end.** ADR 003
  requires stream-shaped task output; full operator-
  internal streaming is V1.x executor work (Candidate E —
  executor model upgrade — territory).
- **Higher retry counts.** ADR 003 ships `max_attempts =
  2`; future ADR raises with evidence of which failure
  modes benefit.
- **Encrypted spill governance.** Spill lifecycle beyond
  M10 seed: key rotation, AAD policy, crash recovery,
  observability, multi-query isolation. ADR 003 +
  ADR 004 share the M10 AES-256-GCM-SIV substrate without
  key rotation.
- **Full DDL propagation.** Async invalidation broadcasts,
  multi-coordinator schema consensus, descriptor
  versioning beyond fingerprint-pin.
- **Wire-protocol cross-version compat.** ADR 003 ships
  reject-on-mismatch; rolling upgrades are V1.x.
- **Decimal numeric types.** Their own ADR; pins decimal-
  specific aggregate semantics.
- **Wendelon-side crate extraction.** `wendelon-types`
  (PBC ops, identity, fingerprint), `wendelon-net`
  (transport facade), `wendelon-schema` (descriptor
  types). Defer until multi-consumer pressure (Polariton,
  Baryon, external Toron SDK) materializes.

### V2+ items

Direction, not near-term plan.

- **Replicated / disaggregated shuffle service.** ADR 003
  per-worker partition store is the V1 substrate; a
  standalone service is V2 when evidence shows producer-
  hosted partitions are the next bottleneck.
- **Direct P2P shuffle as fast path.** V2 optimization
  over the V1 pull-addressed contract.
- **Hybrid vector search.** Vector ANN with metadata
  pushdown into Wendelon. Waits for Wendelon vector-aware
  placement.
- **Visualization-as-compute IR operators.** Density
  tiles, 2D binning, quantile-per-pixel. Waits for
  Polariton's tile protocol.
- **External federation** (Postgres / S3 / BigQuery
  adapters). Explicit ADR 001 §"Deferrals" item — "one
  external adapter as a capability proof," never on the
  Wendelon-native hot path.
- **Materialized views; incremental view maintenance.**
  Requires the executor model to support both batch and
  incremental shapes; far horizon.

### Refinement plumbing *(opportunistic, no ordering)*

Small improvements that don't fit a single ADR.

- **Capability-table aggregate dispatch** replacing the
  enum (when the aggregate catalog grows beyond hand-
  listable).
- **Newtype hygiene pass** — `Symbol` / `ColumnId` instead
  of bare `String` for column refs in narrower contexts.
- **PBC catalog growth** — additional ops promoted from
  experimental to stable.
- **ADR file renaming pass** — drop the redundant
  `toron_` prefix from `plans/adr/001-003` and
  `plans/impl/001-003` filenames (ADR 004's filename
  already follows the cleaner pattern). Mechanical sed +
  cross-reference update.

## Backlog (parked, may not return)

Ideas explored across iteration rounds in `plans/wip/`
that did not earn forward placement. Kept here as a
record of what the council considered and let go. Items
labeled by ADR cycle.

### ADR 010 cycle

- **Suspend ADR 010 / pivot the council to the Wendelon-side
  ADR 006 production row.** Considered (Gemini iter-0, Codex
  iter-0); rejected. Sound against the roadmap's printed A–E
  candidate list — every entry post-V1 or evidence-blocked — but
  the list predated the silent-drop defect. "Evidence drives
  scope" includes the code. The Wendelon row stays parallel work;
  it is not an ADR 010 blocker.
- **"ORDER BY only" scope (Claude topic iter-0).** Considered;
  superseded by Codex's clause-accounting broadening. Fixing four
  named clauses leaves the *class* open — the next `sqlparser`
  field is the next silent drop.
- **Two-bucket clause accounting (lower / reject).** Considered
  (Claude ADR iter-0); rejected (Codex iter-1). `sqlparser` 0.54
  `Select` carries non-semantic parser-metadata fields
  (`select_token`, `top_before_distinct`,
  `window_before_qualify`); routing them to "unsupported"
  overclaims. Three buckets — lowered / rejected-when-present /
  metadata-ignored — is the honest model.
- **`LIMIT` without `ORDER BY` via an implicit total-order
  tie-break.** Considered; rejected (Gemini topic iter-1). A bare
  `LIMIT` that silently triggers a full-dataset sort hides a
  performance cliff. Reject and force the user to declare
  ordering intent.
- **`ORDER BY` keys resolvable against pre-projection input.**
  Considered (Gemini ADR iter-0, Codex topic iter-1); rejected
  (Claude topic iter-2 S1, Codex ADR iter-1). It forces `Sort`
  below `Project` plus hidden-column machinery and leaves the
  total-order tie-break surface undefined. Output-schema-only
  keys; input-only keys are a named V1.x extension.
- **Tie-break keys constructed inside `SortExec`.** Considered
  (Claude ADR iter-0); rejected (Codex iter-1) for bind-time
  appending — the physical plan is then self-contained and
  inspectable.
- **Reject float sort keys in V1.** Considered (Claude ADR iter-0
  P0.5 fork); rejected (Codex iter-2). A sort key needs only a
  stable total order (Arrow IEEE 754) — distinct from float
  *join* keys, which need sound equality semantics and stay
  rejected.
- **Defer `ORDER BY` ordinals to V1.x.** Considered (Claude ADR
  iter-0 P0.7 fork); rejected (Codex iter-2). 1-based positive
  output ordinals resolve by position with no alias or
  hidden-column machinery — same "output-schema-only" class as
  column names.
- **Clause accounting as a table test only.** Considered;
  rejected (Claude topic iter-2 S2). A table test catches only
  enumerated clauses; the compile-time no-`..` destructure
  catches a clause nobody has seen yet.
- **New `TaskFailureKind::SortMemoryExhausted`.** Considered;
  rejected. Sort memory exhaustion is a budget event;
  `TaskFailureKind::BudgetExhausted { dimension:
  BudgetDimension::Memory, .. }` already exists. ADR 003
  7-variant guard preserved.
- **Leaving broadcast ordered joins out of the fragmenter
  path.** Considered; rejected (Codex iter-2). SQL lowering emits
  the same `Sort(Exchange₁(…))` shape regardless of join
  strategy; the post-join terminal gather-sort is shared and
  strategy-agnostic, not hash-partitioned-only.
- **Folding `DISTINCT` into ADR 010.** Considered; rejected.
  `DISTINCT` is `GROUP BY <all output columns>` with no
  aggregates — an aggregate-path concern. Closing its silent drop
  is in scope; implementing it is not.
- **Distributed range sort / external merge sort (spill) in
  V1.** Considered; rejected. Range-partition exchange,
  ordered-merge, skew mitigation, cost model — each its own
  scope. V1 is one in-memory terminal gather-sort; both
  extensions are named, evidence-driven V1.x ADRs.

### ADR 009 cycle

- **Treating ADR 009 as the first post-V1 ADR (to select
  Candidate A, multi-tenant governance).** Considered — the
  roadmap's candidate ordering lists A first; rejected. The
  V1-target paragraph lists multi-tenant governance as post-V1,
  and no post-ADR-008 evidence surfaces multi-tenancy as the
  binding constraint while a routine V1 SQL-surface gap is open.
  Claude iter-0 surfaced the roadmap internal tension; Gemini
  iter-1 and Codex iter-1 resolved it explicitly — ADR 009 is a
  V1 ADR.
- **Candidate B (cross-process wire efficiency) as ADR 009.**
  Considered; rejected as premature. B is the compute-ring
  fallback whose promotion condition ("ADR 006's selective bench
  misses") could not be evaluated until the Wendelon row landed.
  Selecting B then would have front-run that evidence; it now
  reopens only if later production-scale evidence misses.
- **General subquery execution engine.** Considered; rejected.
  ADR 009 is a narrow SQL-AST rewrite, not a subquery IR node +
  executor. The general engine is unbounded scope; the rewrite
  covers the routine analytical pattern with zero new execution
  surface.
- **Subquery joins in the V1 body.** Considered (Claude iter-0's
  "base relation or join"); rejected (Codex iter-1). Subquery
  joins widen side-resolution and residual-placement rules —
  scope bleed the narrow-ADR discipline exists to stop. Named,
  deferred extension; ADR 009 V1 is one `TableFactor::Table`.
- **Uncorrelated `EXISTS` in the same cycle.** Considered;
  rejected. Not a semi/anti rewrite — a scalar cardinality
  check. It falls out of the two-scope classifier as
  zero-correlation-pairs and stays unsupported.
- **Inner-only residual defined as "both sides resolve in the
  inner scope."** Considered (Claude iter-1 S1 phrasing);
  rejected (Codex iter-1) for "no outer references and lowerable
  against the inner relation" — the latter correctly admits
  literal predicates like `dim.active = true`.
- **A new unqualified-name resolution rule for subqueries.**
  Considered; rejected. ADR 009 should not grow fragile
  name-resolution machinery; unqualified / ambiguous correlation
  rejects, and the contract widens for free if later planner
  work hardens scoping.
- **`IN` / `NOT IN` decorrelation.** Considered as adjacent
  scope; rejected. `NOT IN`'s three-valued NULL logic is a
  separate decision matrix; its own ADR.
- **New error variant for unsupported `EXISTS` shapes.**
  Considered; rejected. No new failure class — the existing
  unsupported-expression class is the right surface (ADR 008
  P0.8 discipline).
- **New architecture guard for ADR 009.** Considered; rejected.
  ADR 009 changes no serialized shape and adds no variant —
  there is nothing to pin. It asserts the ADR 003 / 004 / 008
  guard set stays green instead.

### ADR 008 cycle

- **Six-variant `JoinKind` (no `RightSemi` / `RightAnti`).**
  Considered (Claude iter-0); rejected. `sqlparser` 0.54 exposes
  both directions natively and the executor's build-left /
  probe-right machinery supports both with identical
  infrastructure (`Right*` probe-time-decided; `Left*` after-pass
  on build-side bitmap). Excluding right-side would fragment the
  SQL surface without simplifying the implementation. Codex's
  symmetry argument was load-bearing.
- **Broadcast rewrite for non-Inner kinds** (sides-swap
  `RightOuter` → `LeftOuter`, fallback `FullOuter` →
  `HashPartitioned`). Considered (Claude iter-0); rejected.
  Strategy-dependent semantics blur the operator-level scale
  boundary — the binder would accept `Broadcast` but the planner
  would rewrite it, making the "what's the strategy" question
  ambiguous. Cleaner contract: binder rejects `Broadcast` for
  `kind != Inner`; SQL planner already defaults to
  `HashPartitioned` for non-Inner kinds. A strategy-rewrite ADR
  can follow if evidence supports it.
- **`EXISTS` / `NOT EXISTS` decorrelation to `Semi` / `Anti`.**
  Considered (Claude iter-0, Gemini iter-1); rejected for ADR
  008 scope. Subquery-planner contract requires its own decision
  matrix: which patterns are decorrelated, how does the planner
  detect them, how does the binder fold them. ADR 008 ships the
  `Semi` / `Anti` operators; a later subquery-planner ADR can
  leverage them. Promoted as ADR 009.
- **Per-kind probe loops without a row-selection intermediate.**
  Considered (Claude iter-0); rejected in favor of Codex's
  `JoinOutputRow` design. Per-kind loops duplicate null-fill code
  across paths and make the in-memory / spilled selection logic
  divergent (each kind reasoning about emission separately).
  Centralizing on `JoinOutputRow` means one selection/materializer
  contract — the spilled path emits the same selection
  representation after lookup (no spill-format change; ADR 005
  build-side-hash-page format is reused unchanged).
- **Sentinel-based null fill.** Considered as performance
  alternative; rejected. Breaks the Arrow contract, requires
  per-type sentinel choices, couples to downstream readers, and
  hidden semantics make outer-join output not interchangeable
  with inner-join output. Arrow's native `NullBuffer` is the
  canonical representation.
- **Loosen runtime-filter eligibility to outer / semi / anti.**
  Considered; rejected for ADR 008. A Bloom filter on the build
  side of a left-outer join would eliminate probe rows that
  don't match the build — but those are exactly the rows the
  outer join must preserve with null fill. `RightAnti` depends
  on emitting unmatched probe rows. A "filter + preserve"
  combined operator is the separable design; reserved as ADR 010
  Candidate C (V1.x runtime-filter extensions).
- **New `TaskFailureKind::JoinSemantics` variant.** Considered;
  rejected. No new failure class exists — the eight join kinds
  use existing build/probe/spill machinery and the existing
  budget envelope. Invalid plans surface as `FrontendError`;
  runtime resource failures map to existing
  `BudgetExhausted` / `TaskFailed`. ADR 003 7-variant guard
  stays load-bearing.
- **Second `ExecutionPlan::Join` or `LogicalPlan::Join` physical
  variant** (e.g., `ExecutionPlan::SemiJoin`). Considered;
  rejected. Per-kind physical variants duplicate the operator
  shape (two inputs, keys, strategy, schema) and weaken ADR
  004's single-variant architecture guard. The semantic
  difference belongs in `JoinKind`. `LogicalPlan::Join`
  single-variant guard added in Phase 1E pairs with the existing
  `ExecutionPlan::Join` guard.
- **Rolling coordinator/worker mixed-version semantics for
  `JoinKind`.** Considered as forward-compat affordance;
  rejected. Externally-tagged serde adds variants as new strings
  on the wire; older binaries deserialize unknown variants as
  errors. Promising rolling support would require either
  version-negotiation (cross-ring scope) or a serde fallback
  variant (changes wire semantics for every receiver). Single
  workspace bump, full-fleet upgrade matches the posture from
  prior ADRs.
- **Per-kind task-telemetry counters** (e.g.,
  `outer_rows_null_filled`). Considered; rejected. Existing
  `build_rows` / `probe_rows` / `output_rows` counters are
  sufficient for V1; kind-specific aggregates can be surfaced
  downstream of the task wire if needed. Adding telemetry fields
  is an ADR 003 task-telemetry contract change worth carrying
  only when bench evidence is insufficient.
- **Seven separate ADRs, one per kind.** Considered as
  scope-discipline alternative; rejected. The seven kinds share
  the same build-left / probe-right substrate, the same
  null-fill machinery, the same spill semantics. Splitting would
  duplicate contract framing five times without adding
  evidence-driven decisions. The scale-boundary section already
  prevents scope creep.
- **Inner-join regression gate at ±2%** (Claude iter-0 proposal)
  vs ±10% (council convergence). Considered; rejected in favor
  of ±10%. The `JoinOutputRow` refactor introduces measurable
  allocation overhead through the shared materializer; ±10%
  accommodates this without leaving the refactor with no
  guardrail. R13 mitigations are reversible if the bench shows
  >10% regression.
- **Drop IR variants if `sqlparser` regresses a spelling.**
  Considered as cleanup discipline; rejected. The serde wire
  contract and the architecture guard both depend on the IR
  variant set being stable. Fallback is to gate SQL lowering to
  whatever the current dialect parses; keep IR variants.

### ADR 007 cycle

- **Fuel-only V1 sandbox.** Considered (my iter-0 had memory
  enforcement as a V1.x reservation); rejected. Codex iter-0
  argument that a memory bomb fitting within fuel can still OOM
  the host was load-bearing. Memory enforcement is V1 hard
  requirement — Rune-native cap or helper-process isolation
  picked by Phase 0 P0.3.
- **`Context::with_default_modules()` with deny-list tests.**
  Considered (intuitive but fragile to Rune version drift);
  rejected. Allow-list discipline (`Context::new()` + explicit
  registration) inverts the failure mode — new Rune modules
  don't silently widen the attack surface; missing primitives
  break loud rather than capability silently exposed.
- **New `TaskFailureKind` variants
  (`SandboxFuelExhausted` / `SandboxMemoryExhausted`).**
  Considered (Gemini iter-0 proposal); rejected. Preserves the
  ADR 003 7-variant `TaskFailureKind` wire contract. Sandbox
  failures crossing the task wire map to existing
  `TaskFailureKind::TaskFailed { retryable: false, reason:
  "RuneSandbox::<label>" }` — the reason-string mapping is the
  right cross-wire surface.
- **Raw missing-function strings in `CapabilityDenied`.**
  Considered (my iter-0); rejected in favor of
  `CapabilityCategory` enum (`Filesystem`, `Process`, `Network`,
  `Environment`, `Time`, `Random`, `Threading`, `Unknown`). More
  robust against Rune version drift; more useful for client
  tooling. Raw module paths live in internal `tracing` debug
  logs only — never on the public enum.
- **Row-level Rune UDF execution.** Considered (Gemini iter-0
  framed sandbox failures as worker-side UDF failures); rejected
  as out of scope for ADR 007. Rune is frontend-scoped in V1.
  Worker-side execution is a substantial future ADR.
- **Subprocess sandbox with full seccomp + rlimit.** Considered
  as V1 memory-enforcement path; rejected for V1 — heavier than
  necessary. Helper-process isolation (Phase 0 P0.3 path (b))
  is lightweight enough when needed.
- **WASM runtime migration.** Considered as stronger sandboxing;
  rejected — would replace M7's authoring surface entirely. Out
  of scope; reserved for future ADR if Rune sandbox proves
  insufficient.
- **No architecture guard for `Context::with_default_modules`
  absence.** Considered as my iter-0 default; rejected in favor
  of conditional escape firing. Source-level grep guard at
  `tests/architecture_test.rs` is the right defense against
  silent regression to default-allow. Mirrors ADR 005 hard gate
  14 / ADR 006 hard gate 15 pattern.
- **Wall-timeout as primary CPU accounting.** Considered;
  rejected. Fuel is primary; wall-timeout is defense-in-depth
  belt against broken fuel implementation. Legitimate scripts
  never observe `Timeout` under normal operation — fuel
  exhaustion fires first.
- **`AllowProfile` as `Option<String>` or absent in V1.**
  Considered (single-profile means the field is redundant);
  kept as named enum with one variant
  (`AllowProfile::ToronAuthoring`). V1.x extension is then
  type-system-checked, no `RuneSandboxConfig` shape churn.
- **`execute_script(script, fuel)` compatibility shim
  preserved.** Considered (keep the existing signature, ignore
  fuel arg, add a separate `execute_script_with_config`
  method); rejected. The dead `_fuel` parameter cannot remain
  load-bearing. `execute_script(script, &config)` is the V1
  signature; a transitional wrapper is acceptable if it
  constructs a config from the fuel arg, not if it ignores it.

### ADR 006 cycle

- **Filter generation inside `execute_inner_join`.** Original
  Claude/Gemini iter-1 framing; rejected. Codex iter-2's
  stage-order-honesty correction showed that a filter built in
  the join consumer runs after both producer-side shuffles
  complete — too late to attack the bytes-movement bucket.
  The two-wave hash-partitioned shape moves filter generation
  to the build-side exchange producer.
- **Broadcast-only V1 (ADR 006), hash-partitioned filter as
  ADR 007.** Considered (Claude iter-3 option b); rejected.
  Fits one ADR cycle but doesn't move the 10M x 1M
  hash-partitioned promotion workload that produced the ADR 006
  signal — the bench artifact would have nothing to show
  against ADR 005's baseline. Half-ships the contract.
- **Split into ADR 006 (stage-order contract) + ADR 007 (filter
  implementation).** Considered (Claude iter-3 option c);
  rejected. Two ADRs for what is realistically one feature;
  the stage-order decision is meaningless without the filter
  motivating it.
- **Exact `InList` filters in V1.** Considered (Claude/Codex
  iter-2); rejected for V1 in favor of Bloom-only. Reasoning:
  the first cross-ring runtime-filter ADR should prove the
  cross-ring + stage-order contract, not multiply filter kinds.
  `InList` extends the same descriptor contract in V1.x.
- **Cost-based planner opt-in in V1.** Considered; rejected.
  Planner-stats surface doesn't yet exist. Always-two-wave in
  V1; opt-in is V1.x once stats land.
- **Topic E (cross-process wire efficiency) as ADR 006.**
  Considered (Claude iter-1 as a real candidate); demoted to
  fallback. Lower leverage than runtime filters on selective
  joins: moves bytes faster vs avoids moving rejected bytes.
  Reopens as ADR 007 if ADR 006's selective bench misses.
- **Row-group skip as required V1 enforcement.** Considered;
  rejected for required-status. Bloom membership is
  per-encoded-key; row-group min/max stats do not automatically
  prove Bloom absence for a range. Row-level reject is the
  sound V1 enforcement; row-group skip stays opportunistic and
  separately proven.
- **Runtime-plumbing investigation as ADR 006.** Possible
  branch of ADR 005's conditional rule; resolved by ADR 005
  evidence to operator-adjacent (`framework_overhead_ms` fell
  78.8% proportionally with `build_ms`'s 79.0%). Not on the
  ADR 006 table.
- **New runtime-filter telemetry columns in V1.** Considered
  (would sharpen filter-effectiveness measurement); rejected
  in favor of bench evidence only. ADR 005's columns plus the
  selective + non-selective bench rows suffice. New telemetry
  fields are an ADR 003 task-telemetry contract change;
  worth it only when bench evidence is insufficient.
- **Always-emit fragments (no eligibility check).** Considered
  for simplicity; rejected. Composite-key joins, non-canonical
  key types, and broadcast joins should not pay filter
  generation overhead. Eligibility check is single-column +
  inner + hash-partitioned + canonical-encoder-supported type.
- **`nilket-shared` as required new crate.** Considered (Codex
  iter-3 / Gemini iter-4 named it); softened to default
  recommendation only. Extending an existing Wendelon-published
  schema crate is preferred over spawning a new crate before
  multi-consumer pressure justifies it (roadmap "Wendelon-side
  crate extraction" convention). Final crate choice is Phase 1
  implementation detail, not contract-level.

### ADR 005 cycle

- **Streaming push-based executor as ADR 005.** Pre-telemetry
  working hypothesis (Volcano → push-based, morsel parallelism,
  end-to-end streaming). Rejected outright by ADR 004's
  post-promotion telemetry: probe + output combined at ~7% of
  wall; the rewrite addresses ~0% of measured bottleneck.
  Reserved for the case where a future workload shifts probe-side
  to the dominant bucket; until then, this stays demoted.
- **Sub-attribution-first investigation of the 38% residual as
  ADR 005.** Considered (Codex iter-1 framing); rejected because
  the build bucket is sharper and the conditional ADR 006 rule
  resolves the residual question for free in most cases.
- **Fast-path eligibility extending broadly in V1.** Considered
  (Gemini iter-1 — all primitive integer types in V1); rejected
  in favor of the conservative `Int64`/`Int32` default. Each
  extension carries a parity-test and logical-type-tag obligation;
  Phase 0 evidence may justify extending within this ADR.
- **Pin a specific hash table layout in the ADR.** Considered
  (open addressing vs chaining vs Swiss table). Rejected: the
  contract pins invariants, layout is Phase 0 calibration evidence.
- **Hash function change** (replacing `xxh3_64` with ahash /
  wyhash). Rejected — partition-assignment consistency requires
  `xxh3_64` parity. Operator-local hash-table choice must preserve
  the ADR 003 §5 boundary.
- **Concurrent / sharded hash-table build in V1.** Considered as
  Candidate (morsel-parallel build inside a worker); rejected.
  Adds sharded-table determinism, per-thread memory accounting,
  and allocator questions needing their own evidence. V1.x with
  its own ADR.
- **Two-band conditional ADR 006 rule** (operator-adjacent vs
  flat, no gray zone). Considered (Codex iter-1 / Gemini iter-2
  framings); rejected for the explicit three-band rule with
  numeric thresholds (≥50%, ≤20%, gray) plus the "both fail"
  reopen branch.
- **New telemetry columns to sharpen residual attribution within
  ADR 005.** Considered as ADR-005 precondition; rejected as it
  would turn ADR 005 back into attribution work. ADR 004's columns
  are sufficient; the conditional ADR 006 rule resolves the
  remaining question.
- **Mandatory flamegraph diff** (baseline vs post) in bench
  artifact. Considered (iter-3 open question); rejected — the
  dominant-hot-path note is the load-bearing evidence; flamegraph
  file reference is optional.

### ADR 004 cycle

- **Hash-only V1.** Considered as a narrow scope (Claude
  iter-3); rejected because star-schema workloads waste
  shuffle bytes on the small-dim side without broadcast.
  Bounded broadcast with three caps is cheap enough to
  land alongside.
- **Unbounded broadcast.** Replication-storm risk;
  rejected. The three-cap regime is non-negotiable.
- **Right = build (V1 default).** Considered as
  convention-matching with most SQL engines (Claude iter-2,
  Codex iter-3); rejected for consistency with the visual
  order of the `LogicalPlan::Join.left` field. Build =
  left across both strategies.
- **Cost-based strategy selection in V1.** Considered as
  ideal default (Gemini iter-1); rejected because Toron
  has no cost model. Programmatic strategy selection is
  V1's contract; cost-based engagement is V1.x.
- **Runtime filter (exact PBC `InList`) as ADR 004 soft
  gate.** Codex iter-1 / iter-3 middle path; rejected
  because filter-collection plumbing on the coordinator
  is its own optimization surface deserving its own ADR.
- **Bloom filter pushdown as ADR 004 hard gate.** Gemini
  iter-2 framing; rejected for the same reason —
  cross-ring contract surface deserves its own ADR.
- **Operator-state hash spill deferred to V1.x.** Codex
  iter-1 / Claude iter-2 position; rejected because V1's
  "First Query with Integrity" requires realistic large-
  build joins to succeed gracefully. Encrypted spill in
  scope.
- **Reject duplicate output column names at the binder.**
  Codex iter-2 position; rejected because it conflates
  SQL-surface naming with bound-IR ordinal semantics.
  SQL planner is the right layer for naming discipline.
- **`JoinSide { Left, Right }` tag on `ResolvedColumn`.**
  Gemini iter-3 alternative; rejected because side is
  structural (encoded in `left_keys` / `right_keys`
  field names), not metadata.
- **Separate `ExecutionPlan::HashJoin` and
  `BroadcastJoin` variants.** Claude iter-3 position
  (before broadcast came back into scope); rejected for
  `Join { strategy }` field-discriminated which scales
  cleanly to V1.x.
- **`BuildSide` enum field on `Join` in V1.** Considered;
  rejected because it would be a single-value
  `BuildSide::Left` reserved for V1.x. Convention
  forbids reservation.
- **Streaming-spill probe-side as alternative to hash-
  table spill.** Gemini topics Topic 8 alternative
  ("streaming join that spills the probe side if the
  build side fits in RAM"); rejected because probe-side
  is naturally streaming (no buffering needed) — the
  build side is the operator-local memory hot spot.
- **Bundling ADR 003 telemetry residual into ADR 004
  Phase 0.** Gemini iter-2 framing; rejected for commit
  boundary cleanliness — remains a separate `chore:` slice
  outside ADR 004 promotion.
- **Inline broadcast payload in `StartTask`.** Considered
  as zero-extra-hop optimization; rejected because it
  conflicts with ADR 003 pull-addressing and would
  introduce a wire-message-size-dependent dispatch path.
- **Auto-rename duplicate output columns at the binder
  (e.g., `lhs_x` / `rhs_x`).** Considered as
  caller-friendly default; rejected for V1 explicit-
  qualification discipline.

### ADR 003 cycle (preserved from prior roadmap)

- **New IR level below `ExecutionPlan`** (`PhysicalFragment`
  vocabulary). Considered; rejected because `TaskSpec`
  wraps the bound plan without adding translation surface.
- **Pure spill-to-pull as V1 default shuffle.** Considered
  for max resilience; rejected because disk-write +
  decrypt latency on every shuffle is unacceptable for
  in-memory-sized queries.
- **Transport-native flow control alone as backpressure
  contract.** Considered; rejected because wire-level
  flow control can't bound application-level memory or
  shuffle bytes.
- **Schema-registry hardening as ADR 003 alternative.**
  Considered; rejected for lack of high-frequency DDL
  pressure in ADR 002 bench evidence.
- **Stable worker assignment as the determinism gate.**
  Considered; rejected because worker pools are dynamic
  and assignment parity isn't a useful user-facing
  contract.

## What Not To Do Next

Enduring guardrails for upcoming work. Items tied to
specific shipped ADRs live in those ADRs' §"What Not To Do"
sections; this list is the cross-cutting set.

- **Don't adapt DataFusion / Ballista.** ADR 001 rejected;
  ADR 002 / 003 reinforced. The greenfield decision is
  final unless a future ADR cites concrete evidence
  reversing the surface-area-mismatch argument.
- **Don't bundle scope across contract surfaces.**
  Distributed joins, executor model upgrade, runtime
  filter pushdown, outer joins, multi-tenant governance,
  and Rune sandbox enforcement are each their own ADR.
  ADR 003 was intentionally narrow; ADR 004 inherits the
  discipline; ADR 005 stays narrow.
- **Don't ungate experimental kernels by default.** ADR
  002 requires `PlannerConfig::allow_experimental_kernels
  = false`. Each kernel graduates under its own narrow
  ADR.
- **Don't put `Result<_, String>` in any public or module-
  crossing signature.** ADR 002 G3 enforces; ADR 003 G9
  enforces for distributed surface; ADR 004 inherits.
- **Don't skip descriptor-fingerprint validation on PBC
  pushdown.** Silently-wrong-results is the failure mode
  ADR 002 paid complexity to prevent.
- **Don't extract Wendelon types into a shared crate
  before V1.x consumer pressure.** ADR 001 / 002 / 003
  import allowlist holds.
- **Don't bypass the Wendelon import allowlist.**
  Production code consumes `wendelon::schema::{pbc, *types}`,
  `wendelon_client::*`, `wendelon::network::pool::*`,
  `wendelon::storage::file_ops::*`. Forbidden:
  `wendelon::network::raft::*`, `wendelon::network::quic::*`,
  `wendelon::storage::lsm::*`, ad-hoc page readers,
  anything inside Wendelon's node / raft / transport
  internals.
- **Don't query Wendelon for ring placement.** ADR 003
  V1 is location-agnostic; ADR 004 inherits. Locality
  routing is V1.x.
- **Don't initiate P2P-push from producer to consumer.**
  ADR 003 G11 enforces. Consumers always pull via
  `PullPartition`.
- **Don't use `tokio::time::sleep` for backpressure** in
  the production worker path. ADR 003 G10 enforces. The
  per-query budget envelope is the contract.
- **Don't dispatch `LogicalPlan` to workers.** ADR 003
  G12 enforces. Coordinator binds; workers receive
  `TaskSpec`.
- **Don't let `MorselId` cross the wire.** ADR 003 G14
  enforces. Worker-local scheduling detail only.
- **Don't introduce a new IR level below `ExecutionPlan`.**
  `TaskSpec` wraps; it doesn't transform.
- **Don't conflate task-lifecycle failures with partition-
  store wire errors.** `TaskFailureKind` is 7 variants;
  `PartitionMissing` is a wire response carrying
  `PartitionMissingReason`, not a `TaskFailed` variant.
- **Don't start Stage N+1 tasks before Stage N manifests
  are accepted.** ADR 003 G13 enforces strict barrier;
  ADR 004 G18 generalizes for multi-upstream.
- **Don't promise byte-identical Arrow output without
  canonical normalization.** ADR 003 §13 normalization
  (concat → full-row sort → reslice → digest) is the
  contract; ADR 004 reuses unchanged.
- **Don't require stable worker assignment for
  determinism.** ADR 003 output parity is the contract.
- **Don't promote a kernel without a bench-evidence
  artifact.** Wendelon ADR 070 pattern — narrow ADR +
  bench results + roadmap update, every time.
- **Don't open the next ADR with a mega-scope.** One
  contract surface per ADR; bundling defers real
  decisions.
- **Don't promote stabilization watch items into roadmap
  items.** Observability metrics, architectural-test
  guards, post-merge dashboards belong in runbooks and
  impl plans. Decision-enabling measurement belongs
  inside the owning ADR.
- **Don't introduce non-pinned join algorithms.** ADR 004
  G16 enforces. Sort-merge, nested-loop, non-equi joins,
  cross join — each is its own future ADR. Outer / semi / anti
  joins now pinned by ADR 008 (eight-variant `JoinKind`); the
  underlying hash-build / probe-right algorithm is unchanged.
- **Don't reject duplicate output column names at the
  binder.** ADR 004 architectural division puts naming
  in the SQL planner, ordinals in the bound IR.
- **Don't synthesize `Exchange` in the fragmenter.** The
  planner emits explicit `Exchange` above each join /
  aggregate input; the fragmenter never adds operators.
- **Don't allow broadcast to bypass caps.** ADR 004
  pinned three caps; over-cap fails terminal; no silent
  strategy switch.
- **Don't reserve placeholder fields, message slots, or
  PBC ops for deferred features.** Convention
  `no-premature-backward-compat.md`. The future ADR adds
  the surface when it pins the contract.
- **Don't bundle ADR 003 telemetry residual into ADR 004
  feature commits.** Separate `chore:` slice (ADR 004
  council decision 19).
- **Don't conflate join-build key hashing with
  exchange-partition hashing.** ADR 003 §5 partition assignment
  uses `xxh3_64(canonical_encoded_bytes)`; ADR 005's fast-path
  key representation is operator-local. Helper names must make
  the boundary explicit ("join build key" vs "exchange partition
  hash"), never a generic "fast hash" that blurs them. ADR 005
  hard gate 14 conditional architecture guard.
- **Don't let an ADR 005 fast-path encoder lose the logical-type
  tag.** `Int32(1)` and `Int64(1)` must remain distinct
  build-side hash keys. ADR 005 hard gate 7 unit-test enforced.
- **Don't promote ADR 005 on wall-clock alone.** `build_ms` is
  the primary signal; digest equality and phase attribution are
  load-bearing. ADR 005 hard gate 16.
- **Don't soften an ADR 005 `build_ms` target miss** into a
  vague "improved" narrative. The bench artifact records the
  explicit gap; the council selects accept-narrower / scope-down
  / shelve.
- **Don't add new contract surface in ADR 005.** No new
  `MessageKind`, IR variant, `BudgetDimension`, task telemetry
  field, public API, Wendelon scan contract, or architecture
  guard (default; conditional escape only). ADR 005 hard gates
  3, 12-14.
- **Don't parallelize hash-table build inside a worker in
  ADR 005.** Sharded concurrent insertion is V1.x with its own
  determinism + budget accounting work.
- **Don't bundle runtime-plumbing investigation into ADR 005.**
  Conditional ADR 006 governed by the three-band rerun rule.
- **Don't generate ADR 006 runtime filters inside
  `execute_inner_join`.** Too late in ADR 004's stage graph;
  the probe-side shuffle has already happened. Filter
  generation lives in the build-side exchange producer wave
  (ADR 006 Decision §1).
- **Don't let ADR 006's runtime-filter hash conflate with the
  exchange-partition hash.** ADR 003 §5 partition assignment
  uses `xxh3_64(canonical_encoded_bytes)`; ADR 006's
  runtime-filter hashing is operator/cross-ring scoped.
  Helper names are semantic ("runtime filter key" vs
  "exchange partition hash"). Generalizes ADR 005's pattern.
  ADR 006 hard gate 15.
- **Don't let an ADR 006 runtime filter affect join
  correctness.** Advisory always — false positives allowed,
  false negatives forbidden. If Wendelon drops the filter for
  any reason, output is byte-identical to filter-disabled.
  ADR 006 hard gate 7 (false-positive tolerance) + hard
  gate 10 (no false negatives).
- **Don't count ADR 013 advisory-drop behavior as production
  runtime-filter application evidence.** Advisory drop is the
  safety fallback; promotion evidence needs an applied Wendelon
  filter with fewer probe rows/bytes and digest equality.
- **Don't add ADR 013 runtime-filter key columns to scan output.**
  Wendelon may fetch probe keys through
  `ColumnFetchRequirement::predicate_columns`, but PBC output is
  still governed by `output_columns`.
- **Don't put `RuntimeFilterDescriptor` into
  `TableQueryOptions`.** ADR 013 keeps options `Copy`; the
  descriptor is query payload carried by runtime-filter-specific
  table-query entry points.
- **Don't start probe-side dispatch before the ADR 006
  build-side runtime-filter barrier opens** when filters are
  enabled. ADR 006 hard gate 13 — the two-wave barrier is
  contractually load-bearing.
- **Don't deserialize ADR 006's runtime-filter descriptor as
  a Toron-private type in Wendelon.** Shared cross-ring schema
  surface only (default: extend an existing Wendelon-published
  schema crate; alternative: `nilket-shared` common module).
- **Don't multiply ADR 006 filter kinds in V1.** Bloom only.
  Exact `InList` is V1.x once the cross-ring contract is
  proven.
- **Don't add ADR 006 planner cost-model opt-in in V1.** Always
  two-wave when the filter is enabled; planner-stats opt-in
  is V1.x once stats exist.
- **Don't couple ADR 006 promotion to lockstep Wendelon-side
  landing.** Advisory invariant makes split-shipment safe.
  Toron-side shipped first; the Wendelon-enabled production row
  arrived through ADR 013.
- **Don't extend ADR 006 filter eligibility to outer / semi /
  anti / sort-merge / non-equi / broadcast joins.** Each is
  its own future ADR (V1.x). Inner + hash-partitioned only in
  V1.
- **Don't soften an ADR 006 selective-row reduction miss**
  into a vague "improved" narrative. The bench artifact
  records the explicit gap; the council selects
  accept-narrower / scope-down (narrow filter eligibility) /
  shelve.
- **Don't promote a runtime-filter ADR without a
  no-false-negative unit test.** The advisory invariant is
  load-bearing; false negatives are contract violations.
  ADR 006 hard gate 10.
- **Don't skip the non-selective guard benchmark.** The
  two-wave barrier cost is real; the guard proves it's
  bounded against ADR 005's `build_ms` baseline. ADR 006
  hard gate 19.
- **Don't skip the Scale boundary section in new ADRs**
  (convention adopted iter-5 of ADR 006). Even when the
  boundary feels obvious, naming it explicitly makes
  scope-creep into adjacent boundaries visible at review
  time. Omit only when truly N/A and say so explicitly.
- **Don't call `Context::with_default_modules()` in the Rune
  engine** (ADR 007 hard gate 19). The V1 contract is
  allow-list (`Context::new()` + explicit registration); a
  future refactor reverting to default-allow opens the
  sandbox. Source-level architecture grep guard at
  `tests/architecture_test.rs` enforces this.
- **Don't ship a fuel-only V1 Rune sandbox.** Memory
  enforcement is V1 hard requirement (ADR 007 hard gate 8). A
  memory bomb that fits within fuel can still OOM the host —
  Rune-native cap or helper-process isolation, not "deferred."
- **Don't add new `TaskFailureKind` variants for sandbox
  failures.** ADR 003 7-variant wire contract is
  architecture-guarded. Sandbox failures crossing the task wire
  map to `TaskFailureKind::TaskFailed { retryable: false,
  reason: "RuneSandbox::<label>" }`.
- **Don't let Rune sandbox failures fall through to
  `RuneRuntime`.** Use the `FrontendError::RuneSandbox`
  variant carrying the typed `RuneSandboxViolation` enum.
  `RuneRuntime` is for genuine script-logic errors only.
- **Don't expose host paths, internal VM state, or Rune
  source positions in coordinator-facing error messages**
  (ADR 007 hard gate 20). `CapabilityCategory` enum abstracts
  over raw module paths for stability and non-leakiness.
- **Don't add native functions to the Rune allow-list without
  threat-model review.** Each new function is a potential
  sandbox-escape vector. Extension is a separate narrow ADR.
- **Don't couple Rune sandbox enforcement to per-tenant
  governance.** Tenant identity is L-3 (multi-tenant
  governance) territory. ADR 007 ships per-*script* budgets;
  per-tenant aggregation is a future ADR when workload evidence
  justifies.
- **Don't treat `wall_timeout` as primary CPU accounting.**
  Fuel is primary; `tokio::time::timeout` around
  `async_complete()` is a defense-in-depth belt that fires only
  at .await yield points (Rune 0.13.4 drives the VM via a
  synchronous `vm.run()` inside `async_resume()`). Real
  preemption of a CPU-bound loop with broken fuel comes from the
  Phase 4 helper-process parent-side SIGKILL deadline, not the
  Tokio timeout. The infinite-loop hard gate (gate 7) must
  assert `FuelExhausted`, not merely `Timeout`.
- **Don't run row-level Rune UDFs in worker tasks under
  ADR 007.** Rune is frontend-scoped in V1 (script →
  `LogicalPlan` → distribution). Worker-side execution is a
  substantial future ADR.
- **Don't introduce a second `ExecutionPlan::Join` or
  `LogicalPlan::Join` physical variant** (ADR 008 hard gates
  22, 23). Per-kind physical variants duplicate the operator
  shape and weaken ADR 004's single-variant architecture guard.
  The semantic difference belongs in `JoinKind`.
- **Don't use sentinel values for null fill in outer joins.**
  Arrow's native `NullBuffer` is the canonical representation;
  sentinels break the contract and couple to downstream readers.
  ADR 008 hard gate 10.
- **Don't loosen runtime-filter eligibility beyond `Inner`.**
  ADR 006 invariant is load-bearing for outer / anti
  correctness. A Bloom filter on the build side of a left-outer
  join would drop the very rows the outer must preserve;
  `RightAnti` depends on emitting unmatched probe rows. ADR 008
  hard gate 17 enforces; a "filter + preserve" combined operator
  is the separable future design (ADR 010 Candidate C).
- **Don't allow `JoinStrategy::Broadcast` for non-Inner
  `JoinKind`.** Broadcast replicates the build side; preserved-
  side or existence variants would emit duplicate unmatched
  rows in every probe partition. ADR 008 hard gate 16 (binder
  rejection) + hard gate 18 (fragmenter defensive guard) form
  the defense-in-depth pair.
- **Don't rewrite `RightOuter` ↔ `LeftOuter` at planner time as
  a workaround for broadcast.** Strategy-dependent semantics
  blur the operator-level scale boundary. The cleaner contract
  is reject-and-defer; a strategy-rewrite ADR can follow if
  evidence supports it.
- **Don't add `EXISTS` / `NOT EXISTS` decorrelation under ADR
  008.** Subquery-planner contract; promoted as ADR 009. ADR 008
  ships the `Semi` / `Anti` operators; ADR 009 layers the
  correlated-`EXISTS` rewrite on top.
- **Don't promise rolling coordinator/worker mixed-version
  semantics for `JoinKind`.** Serde-tagged variants are additive
  but older binaries reject unknown variants. ADR 008 ships at a
  single workspace version bump; cluster upgrades are
  full-fleet, not rolling. Matches the posture from prior ADRs.
- **Don't drop `JoinKind` IR variants if `sqlparser` regresses
  a spelling.** Keep the IR variants; gate SQL lowering to
  whatever parses. Dropping IR variants breaks the serde wire
  contract and ADR 008 hard gate 25 (variant-count architecture
  guard).
- **Don't add per-kind task-telemetry counters for the new join
  kinds.** ADR 003 task-telemetry contract change worth carrying
  only when bench evidence is insufficient. Existing
  `build_rows` / `probe_rows` / `output_rows` counters are
  sufficient for V1; kind-specific aggregates surface downstream
  of the task wire if needed.
- **Don't add a subquery node to Toron's IR for `EXISTS`
  decorrelation.** ADR 009 is a targeted SQL-AST rewrite in
  `SqlPlanner::lower_select`; the logical and physical join
  contract is reused unchanged. A subquery IR node is a general
  subquery-engine decision, not ADR 009's.
- **Don't lower the whole subquery predicate through `lower_expr`
  before classifying.** ADR 009's two-scope classifier operates
  on the `sqlparser` AST so unsafe outer-reference shapes reject
  precisely; a generic lowering pass first would route a mixed
  predicate into a generic filter path. Classify, then lower only
  the accepted `CorrelatedPair` columns and `InnerResidual`
  predicates.
- **Don't invent a new unqualified-name resolution rule for
  subqueries.** ADR 009 rejects unqualified / ambiguous
  correlation rather than guessing. If the existing qualifier
  logic cannot pin one side to the outer scope and one to the
  inner scope, the rewrite is unsupported — "too narrow and
  correct" over matching a permissive engine.
- **Don't decorrelate uncorrelated `EXISTS`, `IN`, or `NOT IN`
  under ADR 009.** Uncorrelated `EXISTS` is a scalar cardinality
  check, not a semi-join; `NOT IN` carries three-valued NULL
  logic that must not be smuggled into anti-join semantics. Each
  is a named, deferred extension with its own decision matrix.
- **Don't widen the ADR 009 subquery body beyond one
  `TableFactor::Table`.** Subquery joins, aggregates, `LIMIT`,
  `DISTINCT`, set ops, and nested subqueries are unsupported and
  reject through the existing path. The classifier's
  `Unsupported` arm is the structural scope boundary.
- **Don't duplicate binder semantic checks in the SQL planner
  for ADR 009.** The planner classifies shape and builds the
  logical rewrite; the binder stays the authority for type
  compatibility, float-key rejection, computed-key rejection,
  exchange shape, and non-Inner broadcast rejection.
- **Don't let `lower_query` / `lower_select` destructure with a
  `..` rest pattern.** ADR 010's exhaustive three-bucket
  no-`..` destructure is the load-bearing clause-accounting
  guard — a `sqlparser` bump that adds a field must be a compile
  error, not a silent widening. A source-level architecture
  guard enforces it; the parser-metadata allow-list
  (`select_token`, `top_before_distinct`,
  `window_before_qualify`) is explicit.
- **Don't silently drop any top-level `Query` / `Select`
  clause.** ADR 010's invariant: every parsed field is
  lowered, rejected-when-present, or bound-and-ignored as parser
  metadata. Silently-dropped `ORDER BY` was the V1 integrity
  defect ADR 010 closed; do not reintroduce the class.
- **Don't accept bare `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` / `FETCH`.** Without an
  `ORDER BY` contract, distributed truncation is arbitrary.
  ADR 010 rejects them; deterministic top-N is
  `ORDER BY ... LIMIT n`.
- **Don't place `Sort` below `Project` or support `ORDER BY` on
  non-output / alias / computed keys.** ADR 010 keys resolve
  against the output schema only (column names + 1-based
  positive ordinals); `Sort` sits above `Project` so the
  total-order tie-break surface is exactly the output columns.
  Input-only keys are a named V1.x extension.
- **Don't ship a partial-order `ORDER BY`.** ADR 010's contract
  is a total order — user keys then every remaining output
  column, ascending `NULLS LAST`, appended at bind time. Ties
  resolved arbitrarily reopen silent nondeterminism.
- **Don't let the fragmenter infer a hidden gather, and don't
  prove the distributed gather-sort with output digest alone.**
  The planner emits the terminal `Exchange { partition_count: 1 }`
  explicitly; the post-join gather-sort is strategy-agnostic
  (hash-partitioned and broadcast) and gated by stage-shape
  inspection. ADR 010 Phase 4 is the named primary risk.
- **Don't add a new `TaskFailureKind`, `BudgetDimension`, IR
  level, or wire surface for ADR 010.** `LogicalPlan` /
  `ExecutionPlan` each gain exactly one variant (`Sort`); sort
  memory exhaustion reuses `BudgetDimension::Memory` →
  `ExecutionError::BudgetExhausted` →
  `TaskFailureKind::BudgetExhausted`. No sort spill, no
  distributed range sort in V1 — both are named V1.x ADRs.
- **Don't implement `DISTINCT` / `GROUP BY` / `HAVING` under
  ADR 010.** They loud-reject; implementing them is
  aggregate-path ADR work. ADR 010 closes their silent drop
  only.
